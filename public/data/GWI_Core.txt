 Methodology 
Each quarter, we field our main Core survey in 50 markets. We also run a shorter mobile version of the same 
survey in 54 markets (including Ghana, Kenya, Morocco and Nigeria). 
 
Most respondents see the main Core survey, with the rest seeing the shorter mobile version, which has been 
optimized for smaller screens and contains slightly fewer questions. Around half of the main survey 
respondents then go on t o complete the brand  media module - a recontact survey containing additional 
questions on brand engagement and media consumption. These three components make up our Core 
study, and are combined and presented as a single data set in our platform. 
Through out this document, questions asked in both the mobile and the main survey are marked by an 
asterisk , while questions asked in brand  media are indicated by two asterisks .
